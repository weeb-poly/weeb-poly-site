#### Biography

Shion is a grad student at RPI/WPI. As a CSE major, they donâ€™t really need the lab coat, but they wear one anyway.

The registrar says that she graduated back in the 1970's, but they also have them marked as an incoming freshman so what do they know.

#### Notes

Personality: cynical, kind, kuudere, sarcastic, stoic

TA for your CSE class (ECSE 4090 - Mechatronics) (idk, I'm not an engineer)

Mecha Fan (Will Rewatch Pacific Rim with you)

SIS-MAN mascot was based on one of their incomplete projects (something about flexing on tall people)
    
Occasionally tries to make jokes and references (El Psy Kongroo) to be "hip" with the "youngins" and cover it up when it inevitably fails
